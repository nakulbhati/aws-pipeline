AWS CodeStar Sample ASP.NET Core Web Application
==================================================

This sample code helps get you started with a simple ASP.NET Core web application
deployed by AWS CodeDeploy and AWS CloudFormation to an Amazon EC2 server.

What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* appspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeDeploy when deploying the web
  application to EC2
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to build the web
  application
* AspNetCoreWebApplication/ - this directory contains your ASP.NET Core application project files
* AspNetCoreWebApplicationTest/ - this directory contains your ASP.NET Core application test files
* scripts/ - this directory contains scripts used by AWS CodeDeploy when
  installing and deploying your application on the Amazon EC2 instance
* template.yml - this file contains the description of AWS resources used by AWS
  CloudFormation to deploy your infrastructure
* template-configuration.json - this file contains the project ARN with placeholders used for tagging resources with the project ID  


Getting Started
---------------

These directions assume you want to develop on your local computer, and not
from the Amazon EC2 instance itself. If you're on the Amazon EC2 instance, the
virtual environment is already set up for you, and you can start working on the
code.

To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your
local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the
AWS CodeStar user guide.

1. Install dotnet.  See https://www.microsoft.com/net/core

2. Build the application

        $ cd AspNetCoreWebApplication
        $ dotnet restore
        $ dotnet build

3. Run Kestrel server.

        $ dotnet run

4. Open http://localhost:5000/ in a web browser to view your web app.


What Do I Do Next?
------------------

Once you have a virtual environment running, you can start making changes to
the sample ASP.NET Core web application. We suggest making a small change to
/AspNetCoreWebApplication/Controller/HomeController.cs first, so you can see how
changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically picked up by your
project pipeline and deployed to the Amazon EC2 instance. (You can watch the
pipeline progress on your project dashboard.) Once you've seen how that works,
start developing your own code, and have fun!

To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the sample code and run the
`dotnet vstest AspNetCoreWebApplicationTest/test_output/AspNetCoreWebApplicationTest.dll` command,
 which AWS CodeBuild also runs through your `buildspec.yml` file.

To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or add tests
to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the build stage of your
project pipeline. You can find the test results in the AWS CodeBuild console.

How Do I Add Template Resources to My Project?
------------------

To add AWS resources to your project, you'll need to edit the `template.yml`
file in your project's repository. You may also need to modify permissions for
your project's worker roles. After you push the template change, AWS CodeStar
and AWS CloudFormation provision the resources for you.

See the AWS CodeStar user guide for instructions to modify your template:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/how-to-change-project#customize-project-template.html

What Should I Do Before Running My Project in Production?
------------------

AWS recommends you review the security best practices recommended by the framework
author of your selected sample application before running it in production. You
should also regularly review and apply any available patches or associated security
advisories for dependencies used within your application.
